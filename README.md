# MERN application

The famous Mongoose-Express-React-Node stack. It is just a simple web-page that works with the CRUD of product objects. 

The application was created after watch [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaScriptMastery) course with MERN which gives me an awesome explanation on how to do build an full-stack project.

# Start-up

To be able to run the application, make sure you install the node-modules before execute or it will display an error. After that, run the command ```npm start``` and open the url specified.

# Motivation

My goal was to learn how to integrate the backend with frontend in a cleaner way that i can understand the proccess. I always have a little bit struggle on that part and now i feel more confident to implement the entire application.

# Copyright

The project has no commercial interest, it is just for studies. Otherwise, it wouldn't be so simple.
